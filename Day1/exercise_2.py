# Exercise 2 - Debugging Practice 

# There are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors. 

# Day 1 - String Manipulation
#String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
#e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
#New lines can be created with a backslash and n.

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g print("Hello" + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backlash and n.")
